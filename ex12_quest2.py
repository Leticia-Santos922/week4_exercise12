# TODO: Question 2 what is going on here? Can you explain the output?

# the concept of length len() function varies depending on the data type
# attention: on data type of a string or tuple only has a small distinction which is a , for string to be a tuple
# tuple is a collection which is ordered
# allows duplicate members

# variable tup is assigned to string 'Hello'
tup = 'Hello'
# len() function: returns the number of characters in the string value 'Hello' which is five
# print function passes the variable tup string argument hello and the result of len function
print(len(tup))

# tuple is a collection which is immutable objects and , makes it a tuple
# used to store items in a single variable
tup = 'Hello',
# len() returns the number of items in a tuple
# print function passes the tuple tup variable argument and the result of len function
print(len(tup))
