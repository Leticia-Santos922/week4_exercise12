# TODO: Question 2 what is going on here? Can you explain the output?

# the concept of length len() function varies depending on the data type
# attention: on data type of a string or tuple as the distinction is a , for string to be a tuple

# variable tup is assigned to string 'Hello'
tup = 'Hello'
# print function passes the variable tup string argument hello and the result of len function
# len() function: refers to the characters in the string value 'Hello' which is five
print(len(tup))

# tuple is a collection which is immutable objects and , makes it a tuple
# used to store items in a single variable
tup = 'Hello',
# the len() function determines how many items a tuple has
# len() refers to the number of elements or items in a tuple
# print function passes the tuple tup variable argument and the result of len function
print(len(tup))
